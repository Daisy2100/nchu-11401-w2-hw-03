2, Source Reference
This project builds upon patterns and datasets related to the Spam Email problem from Chapter 3 of the Packt repository below. We used it to expand the preprocessing steps and add richer visualization work (step outputs, metrics, and CLI/Streamlit views).

📘 Purpose
This homework guides you through an email spam classification project using the OpenSpec (Spec-Driven Development) workflow.
You’ll reproduce and extend Chapter 3 of Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity by:

adding data pre-processing steps,

expanding visualizations and metrics, and

integrating CLI / Streamlit front-ends.
